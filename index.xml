      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been participating in Google Code-in which is Google&amp;rsquo;s initiative to introduce young minds to the concept of FOSS, that is Free or Open-Source Softwares. This post is for sharing my experiences with GCI, as the title suggests. So let&amp;rsquo;s just get on it.
It all began while I was returning from an outing on 5 December, 2017 and was searching the internet for Google Science Fair to check if I could participate in it or not.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrating from Jekyll</title>
      <link>https://dream-plus-posts.netlify.com/posts/migrate-from-jekyll/</link>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
â–¾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ â–¾ images/ logo.png  should become
â–¾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ â–¾ static/ â–¾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>So, Who Am I? 
Iâ€™m just another teenager who likes writing, programming and making stuff. Even setting the title as Who Am I for this article is reminding me of whoami in Linux. I feel the inner urge to contribute something to the Internet because I love writing and I believe posting something online enables users all around the globe to see your work and suggest improvements.
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve also started taking interest in web designing and hosting the fruitful results of which these site and blogs are!</description>
