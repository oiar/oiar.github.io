<h1>So, Who Am I?</h1>

<hr />

<p><br>
Iâ€™m just another teenager who likes <strong>writing</strong>, <strong>programming</strong> and <strong>making stuff</strong>. Even setting the title as <strong>Who Am I</strong>  for this article is reminding me of <code>whoami</code> in Linux. I feel the inner urge to contribute something to the Internet because I love writing and I believe posting something online enables users all around the globe to see your work and suggest improvements.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve also started taking interest in web designing and hosting the fruitful results of which these site and blogs are! I also make <strong>projects</strong> and share them online at <strong>Instructables</strong>, the link of which has been placed on the home page. Making stuff is just one of the things I love the most.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s all that I can think of right now. Hopefully Iâ€™ll add something more to this later on. ðŸ˜…</p>
